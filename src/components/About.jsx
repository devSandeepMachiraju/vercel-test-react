      <p>
        I'm a passionate frontend developer with 5 years of experience in
        building responsive and user-friendly web applications. I love turning
        complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive designs. When I'm
        not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies or contributing
        to open-source projects.
